Below are the reporting/notification (and closely related schedule) deadlines the Site/Institution/PI must follow based only on the provided clauses, incorporating amendment changes.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting to Sponsor
Deadline: within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the event. (Original CTA - HEARTBEAT-3 (January 2022).pdf, §3.4, effective_date: null) [document_id: 917ddbfa-a425-460c-85da-d911bec8785a]
Amendment impact: Amendment 5 reaffirms ongoing “SAE reporting” during the extension period but does not change the 24-hour deadline. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, STUDY_OBLIGATIONS, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
IRB approval required before enrolling any Study Subjects
Deadline/condition precedent: Institution must obtain and maintain IRB approval for the Protocol and Informed Consent Form prior to enrolling any Study Subjects. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
IRB submissions/notifications tied to amendments and study changes
Pandemic-related protocol modifications: Institution must submit amendments to the IRB as necessary to implement pandemic-related Protocol modifications authorized under Section 21.7 (e.g., remote visit procedures; direct-to-patient drug shipment). No specific number-of-days deadline is stated—only that IRB amendments must be submitted “as necessary” to implement those modifications. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
Extended study timeline: Institution must notify the IRB of the extended study timeline via continuing review submission, and must submit “timely continuing review” to maintain approval through study completion. The clause does not define “timely” in days; it does state current IRB approval is valid through March 31, 2025, implying continuing review must be submitted in time to avoid lapse before that date. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
PI change IRB amendment: Institution confirms the IRB has been notified of the PI change and approved Dr. Martinez via IRB amendment dated January 20, 2023 (this is a documented notification/approval event, but the clause does not impose a forward-looking deadline beyond confirming it occurred). (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
Protocol Amendment No. 2: Institution confirms it was submitted to the IRB and approved February 28, 2024, and that subjects were re-consented “as necessary” (no specific re-consent deadline is stated). (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
Study visit schedule obligations that function as operational “deadlines” under the amended timeline These are not “reporting” deadlines per se, but they are explicit timepoint-based obligations the site must follow under the amended study conduct described in the contract amendments:
Follow-up end for most enrolled subjects: subjects who have not yet reached Week 56 will not complete Week 56 or Week 64 visits; follow-up concludes at Week 52 (final visit under revised Protocol). (Amendment 4 - HEARTBEAT-3 (March 2024).pdf, §2.3, effective_date: null) [document_id: 0d0d6b89-40f6-4dfc-a02d-78f952fe04a3]
Biomarker blood sample collection: for all subjects, biomarker blood samples will be collected at remaining Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 visits (if not yet completed). (Amendment 4 - HEARTBEAT-3 (March 2024).pdf, §2.3, effective_date: null) [document_id: 0d0d6b89-40f6-4dfc-a02d-78f952fe04a3]
“Anticipated” study timeline milestones (planning dates; not stated as mandatory reporting/notification deadlines)
Anticipated LPLV: June 2025; anticipated database lock: August 2025; anticipated site closeout: September 2025. These are stated as “anticipated” milestones and do not, in the provided text, impose a site reporting/notification deadline by a fixed number of days. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, STUDY_TIMELINE_UPDATE, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
Earlier anticipated LPLV (superseded operationally by the later extension, but not expressly stated as superseded in the excerpt): September 2024. (Amendment 4 - HEARTBEAT-3 (March 2024).pdf, STUDY_STATUS, effective_date: null) [document_id: 0d0d6b89-40f6-4dfc-a02d-78f952fe04a3]
What is NOT determinable from the provided clauses

Any deadlines for non-SAE safety reporting, protocol deviation reporting, routine data entry timelines, query response SLAs, monitoring follow-up timelines, or sponsor notification timelines other than SAE reporting are not stated in the provided excerpts; therefore they cannot be listed from this record.
Conflicts/ambiguities affecting the answer

The IRB “timely continuing review” obligation is not defined in days; only the IRB approval expiry date (March 31, 2025) is provided, so the exact submission deadline cannot be precisely reconstructed from the excerpts. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, §4.1, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
Study timeline milestones are “anticipated,” so they may not be enforceable “deadlines” for site reporting/notification absent additional contract language not provided here. (Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, STUDY_TIMELINE_UPDATE, effective_date: null) [document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
There is an internal inconsistency between Amendment 4’s anticipated LPLV (Sept 2024) and Amendment 5’s extended LPLV (June 2025); Amendment 5 is later-in-time but the excerpts do not explicitly state it supersedes the earlier projection. (Amendment 4 - HEARTBEAT-3 (March 2024).pdf, STUDY_STATUS; Amendment 5 - HEARTBEAT-3 (November 2024).pdf, STUDY_TIMELINE_UPDATE; effective_date: null) [document_id: 0d0d6b89-40f6-4dfc-a02d-78f952fe04a3; document_id: 4a6a1709-fa5f-4545-8ae4-65f63e35b54c]
