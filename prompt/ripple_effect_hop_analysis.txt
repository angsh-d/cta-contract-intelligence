A change is proposed to Section {section_number}:
  CURRENT: {current_text}
  PROPOSED: {proposed_text}

You are analyzing HOP {hop_number} impacts — clauses that are {hop_number} step(s) away in the dependency graph.

Affected clauses at this hop:
{hop_clauses}

For each clause, determine if the proposed change materially affects it.

Before producing your final answer, reason step-by-step about your analysis.
Include your reasoning in the 'reasoning' field of the JSON output.

Return JSON:
