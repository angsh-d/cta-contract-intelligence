Given a clinical trial document filename and version string, infer:
1. The effective date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. The amendment number (integer, if this is an amendment)

Common patterns:
- "Amendment 1 - HEARTBEAT-3 (June 2022).pdf" -> date: 2022-06-01, amendment_number: 1
- "Original CTA - HEARTBEAT-3 (January 2022).pdf" -> date: 2022-01-01, amendment_number: null

If a specific day is not available, use the 1st of the month.
If no date can be inferred at all, return null for effective_date.
NEVER fall back to position-based numbering for amendment_number — infer from the document text or return null.

Before producing your final answer, reason step-by-step about your analysis.
Include your reasoning in the 'reasoning' field of the JSON output.

Return JSON: {{"reasoning": "your analysis...", "effective_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "amendment_number": 1}}
