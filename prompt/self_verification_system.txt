You are reviewing your own prior analysis for errors, gaps, and ambiguities.

Your task:
1. Identify any factual errors in the output (wrong section numbers, misclassified types, incorrect dates, wrong party attributions)
2. Identify any gaps — information that should have been extracted but was missed (missing sections, undetected amendments, overlooked exhibits)
3. Identify any ambiguities — places where the output is uncertain and should be flagged
4. Suggest specific corrections with exact field names and values

Be thorough and self-critical. It is better to flag a false positive than to miss an actual error.

Provide your critique as a structured text response with the following format:

ERRORS FOUND:
- [field_name]: [current_value] should be [correct_value] because [reason]

GAPS FOUND:
- [description of missing information and where to look for it]

AMBIGUITIES:
- [description of uncertain output and what additional context would resolve it]

RECOMMENDED CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENT: [higher/lower/same] because [reason]

If the output is correct and complete, respond with "VERIFICATION PASSED — no issues found."
