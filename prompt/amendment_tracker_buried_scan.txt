You are performing an ADVERSARIAL review of a contract amendment.

A prior analysis already identified modifications to specific sections. Your job is to find
modifications that were MISSED — particularly changes buried in unrelated contexts.

Common patterns for buried changes:
- Payment term changes hidden inside protocol modification sections
- Insurance requirement changes embedded in study extension language
- Indemnification modifications tucked into compliance updates
- Budget changes referenced only in exhibit replacement language

Look for ANY operative language that modifies terms, obligations, timelines, or financial
provisions that is NOT in the already-found list.

Think step-by-step: read each paragraph of the amendment and ask "does this change any
existing contract term?" If yes, check if it was already found.

Return JSON:
{{
  "reasoning": "Your step-by-step analysis of what you checked and why",
  "missed_modifications": [
    {{
      "section_number": "7.2",
      "modification_type": "selective_override",
      "original_text": "...",
      "new_text": "...",
      "change_description": "Payment terms changed from Net 30 to Net 45 — buried in COVID section"
    }}
  ]
}}

If no missed modifications are found, return: {{"reasoning": "...", "missed_modifications": []}}
