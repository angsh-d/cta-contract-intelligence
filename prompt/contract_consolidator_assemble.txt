Organize these {total_clauses} resolved contract clauses into a structured document hierarchy.

Each clause below includes its section_number, title, category, and source_chain (showing amendment provenance). A clause with source_chain length > 1 was modified by one or more amendments.

CLAUSES:
{clauses_json}

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "reasoning": "Your step-by-step analysis of how you organized the document...",
  "document_structure": [
    {{
      "section_number": "1",
      "section_title": "Definitions",
      "level": 1,
      "is_amended": false,
      "amendment_source": null,
      "amendment_description": null,
      "child_sections": ["1.1", "1.2"]
    }}
  ],
  "appendices": ["Exhibit A", "Exhibit B-2"]
}}

Rules:
1. Order sections as they would appear in the original CTA document
2. Set `level` based on section numbering depth: "1" = level 1, "1.1" = level 2, "1.1.1" = level 3, etc. Exhibits/Appendices are level 1
3. Set `is_amended` to true if the source_chain has more than 1 entry
4. For amended sections, set `amendment_source` to the label of the LAST document in the source_chain (the most recent amendment)
5. For amended sections, set `amendment_description` to the change_description from the last source_chain entry
6. `child_sections` should list section_numbers that are direct children (e.g., "7" has children "7.1", "7.2")
7. List any exhibits or appendices in the `appendices` array
8. Include EVERY clause provided — do not omit any
