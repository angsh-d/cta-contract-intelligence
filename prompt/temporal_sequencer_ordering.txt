Determine the chronological ordering and supersession relationships for these documents:

{documents_json}

Analyze each document and determine:
1. The correct chronological order (considering retroactive dates, conditional effectiveness, etc.)
2. Which document each amendment supersedes (may not be the immediately preceding one)
3. Any warnings about non-obvious temporal relationships

Before producing your final answer, reason step-by-step about your analysis.

Return JSON:
{{
  "reasoning": "your step-by-step analysis of temporal relationships...",
  "chronological_order": ["doc-id-1", "doc-id-2"],
  "supersessions": [
    {{"predecessor": "doc-id-1", "successor": "doc-id-2", "reason": "Amendment 1 supersedes Original CTA"}}
  ],
  "warnings": ["Any non-obvious temporal relationships detected"]
}}
